3. Log File Analyzer:
Create a script that analyzes web server logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx) for
common patterns such as the number of 404 errors, the most requested
pages, or IP addresses with the most requests. The script should output a
summarized report





#!/bin/bash


if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 /path/to/logfile"
    exit 1
fi

LOGFILE=$1

echo "Analyzing log file: $LOGFILE"
echo "----------------------------"


echo "Number of 404 errors:"
grep "404" "$LOGFILE" | wc -l
echo "----------------------------"


echo "Most requested pages:"
awk '{print $7}' "$LOGFILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
echo "----------------------------"


echo "IP addresses with the most requests:"
awk '{print $1}' "$LOGFILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
echo "----------------------------"

echo "Log analysis complete."
