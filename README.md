# WiseCow Deployment

This repository contains the Kubernetes configuration files needed to deploy the WiseCow application. WiseCow is a web application that listens on port 443 for HTTPS traffic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or access to a Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (optional, for managing Kubernetes applications)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the WiseCow application on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wisecow-deployment.git
cd wisecow-deployment

Step 2: Set Up Kubernetes Cluster

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster set up, you can use Minikube to create one:

bash

minikube start

Step 3: Apply Kubernetes Manifests

Apply the deployment and service configuration files to your Kubernetes cluster:

bash

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

Step 4: Configure Ingress (Optional)

If you want to expose your application via an Ingress resource, apply the ingress configuration:

bash

kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

Make sure you have an Ingress controller installed in your cluster (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller).
Step 5: Verify Deployment

Check the status of your pods to ensure the application is running:

bash

kubectl get pods

You should see a pod with a name starting with wisecow-deployment in the Running state.
Step 6: Access the Application

If you're using Minikube, you can access the application using:

bash

minikube service wisecow-service

For a production cluster, access the application via the configured Ingress host or LoadBalancer IP.
Files in This Repository

    deployment.yaml: Defines the deployment for the WiseCow application.
    service.yaml: Defines the service to expose the WiseCow application.
    ingress.yaml: Defines the ingress resource for routing external traffic to the WiseCow application.

TLS Configuration

To enable HTTPS, make sure to configure TLS certificates correctly. You can create a Kubernetes secret to store your TLS certificates and reference it in your Ingress configuration.
Create a TLS Secret

bash

kubectl create secret tls wisecow-tls-secret --cert=path/to/tls.crt --key=path/to/tls.key

Update the ingress.yaml file to reference this secret.
